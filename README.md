# Bus-Map

In this exercise we used the Mapbox API to create an animated map that shows the stops along the bus route between MIT and Harvard in Cambridge. 

## Installation

Clone the files to your local machine and open them in your prefered code editor where you can preview the working map. Click on the text box on the top of the page to begin moving the flags along the bus route. 

## Future plans

I hope to one day experiment in locating motorized scooters (bird/spin) that are charged and within a certain range of the bus stops.
